# sm64quiz
## Feb. 28, 2018

A quiz on Mario 64. Our first assignment from Grade 12 CS, and our intro to PHP. This was plenty of fun to make, and kicked off the trend of Mario 64-themed projects in Grade 12. 

Original site preserved at https://sm64quiz.the404.nl

08/03/20: Now hosted on GH Pages, and removed from the404. Since GHP doesn't do PHP, you won't be able to view results or submit the quiz, but the rest still works.
